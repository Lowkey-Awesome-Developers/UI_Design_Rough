<h1>In-game Player UI</h1>

Utilising the gameplay loops I designed, see 'Gameplay_Loops' github repository I can get a good idea of some of the functions that are needed for the player to access in the UI. In addition to my gameplay loop designs, like all of my designs for this project I looked at the PS4 monopoly game for a starting place and general direction, see below.
